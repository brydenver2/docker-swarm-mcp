# Docker TLS Configuration

## Overview
Secure communication with remote Docker daemons using TLS certificates.

## Short Description
Docker supports TLS for securing connections to remote Docker daemons. This is essential when exposing Docker's API over a network, providing authentication and encryption for all communications.

## Key Features
- Mutual TLS authentication (client and server certificates)
- Encrypted communication channel
- Certificate-based access control
- Support for custom Certificate Authorities (CA)
- Compatible with Docker Engine API and Swarm mode
