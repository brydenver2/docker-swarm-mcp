# Model Context Protocol

## Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for defining and managing context for models, focusing on versioning, interoperability, and client-server communication.

## Short Description
MCP is a specification for a JSON-RPC based protocol that allows language model clients and servers to communicate in a structured way. It defines methods for discovering and using prompts, tools, and other resources, enabling more sophisticated and reliable interactions with language models.

## Key Features
- Standardized discovery and use of prompt templates.
- JSON-RPC for structured client-server communication.
- Support for Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time, bidirectional communication.
- Capability negotiation to ensure client and server compatibility.
- A well-defined interface for tool discovery, invocation, and schema definition.
